Python 3

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Download all prerequisites. Also download .py file you want to run. If it is more convinient for you - download development environment for Python. And download folders test and train with all content or other data but with same nesting of folders and files.

### Prerequisites

To get started working with Python 3, youâ€™ll need to have access to the Python interpreter. That involves downloading the appropriate installer for your operating system and running it on your machine.
Some operating systems, notably Linux, provide a package manager that can be run to install Python.
On macOS, the best way to install Python 3 involves installing a package manager called Homebrew. 

```
Download installer for Windows at python.org. Scroll to the bottom and select either Windows x86-64 executable installer for 64-bit or Windows x86 executable installer for 32-bit.

```

### Installing

If you decided not to download development environment:
* Put .py file you've downoaded in the same folder with data folders (test and train)
* Run cmd and check you Python with command below

```
$ python
```

* If everything is OK run the python file with the same command

```
$ python multithreaded.py
```

* If it didn't work, you probably running it in the wrong place. Go to the file location in cmd before running

If you decided to download development environment:
* Open you development environment and get started
* Create a project
* Put .py files and folders with data to your project folder
* Run it
